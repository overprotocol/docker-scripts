Useful scripts to run Over Protocol with Docker üê≥

## Initial Set Up

1. Check if the latest version of Docker is available

```

2. Export your public IP for discovery

```bash
export PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)
echo $PUBLIC_IP
```

3. Initialize data directory and JWT token

## Run a full node

Run containers using script:

```bash
docker compose -f mainnet.yml up -d
```

To check logs, you can use following command:

docker logs chronos -f # For inspect the consensus client
```


### Q&A

**Q) I would like to run a consensus client without checkpoint sync.**

A) The scripts are based on the usage of our official checkpoint sync URL. If you want to sync your consensus client from genesis,
you could replace `--checkpoint-sync-url` flag into `--genesis-beacon-api-url`.
